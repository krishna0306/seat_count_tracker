# seat_count_tracker
The Seat Count Tracker Telegram Bot is a Python script that leverages the RapidAPI and Telegram API to monitor seat availability on specific train routes. This tool allows users to set a threshold for seat availability, and when the count falls below the specified limit, the bot sends real-time notifications via Telegram
